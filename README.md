**DogCatcher** is a web app where you can find the most cute and friendly pets, search them by breed and, if you liked that spongy white hair cat you can save him in your favorites.

Discover a lot of dog and cat breeds that you didn't know existed, learn about their caracteristics, temperament... just know more about those pets, and then maybe, adopt one of them :wink:

### DogCatcher is currently in development

<br />

This web app is in active development by me, Darwin Lozada. DogCatcher is a very special project for me, because of my love for cats (yeah I am Team Cats), and the fact that it is inspired by my cute Cat called **Star**:star: Stay tuned for this!
